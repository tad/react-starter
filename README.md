# What is this?

Quick setup for react apps using webpack and babel.

Doing stuff this way allows you to:
* push up a minimum amount of code to your site
* write your code in the latest javascript
* use `npm start` to start a local webserver, opening a web page, and will watch for changes and rebuild.

To use:
`npm run build`
`npm start`
